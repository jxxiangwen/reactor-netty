= Getting Started

This section contains information that should help you get going with `Reactor Netty`. It
includes the following information:

* <<getting-started-introducing-reactor-netty>>
* <<prerequisites>>
* <<getting-started-understanding-bom>>
* <<getting>>

[[getting-started-introducing-reactor-netty]]
== Introducing Reactor Netty

Suited for Microservices Architecture, `Reactor Netty` offers
backpressure-ready network engines for `HTTP` (including Websockets), `TCP`, and `UDP`.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

`Reactor Netty` runs on `Java 8` and above.

It has transitive dependencies on:

* Reactive Streams v1.0.3
* Reactor Core v3.x
* Netty v4.1.x

[[getting-started-understanding-bom]]
== Understanding the BOM

`Reactor Netty` is part of the `Project Reactor BOM` (since the `Aluminium` release train).
This curated list groups artifacts that are meant to work well together, providing
the relevant versions despite potentially divergent versioning schemes in these artifacts.

The `BOM` (Bill of Materials) is itself versioned, using a release train scheme
with a codename followed by a qualifier. The following list shows a few examples:

[verse]
Aluminium-RELEASE
Californium-BUILD-SNAPSHOT
Aluminium-SR1
Bismuth-RELEASE
Californium-SR32

The codenames represent what would traditionally be the `MAJOR.MINOR` number. They (mostly)
come from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table#Overview[Periodic Table of
Elements], in increasing alphabetical order.

The qualifiers are (in chronological order):

* `BUILD-SNAPSHOT`
* `M1`..`N`: Milestones or developer previews
* `RELEASE`: The first `GA` (General Availability) release in a codename series
* `SR1`..`N`: The subsequent `GA` releases in a codename series (equivalent to `PATCH`
number -- `SR` stands for `Service Release`).

== Getting Reactor Netty

As <<getting-started-understanding-bom,mentioned earlier>>, the easiest way to use
`Reactor Netty` in your core is to use the `BOM` and
add the relevant dependencies to your project. Note that, when adding such a dependency,
you must omit the version so that the version gets picked up from the `BOM`.

However, if you want to force the use of a specific artifact's version, you can specify
it when adding your dependency as you usually would. You can also forgo the `BOM` entirely
and specify dependencies by their artifact versions.

=== Maven Installation

The `BOM` concept is natively supported by `Maven`. First, you need to import the `BOM` by
adding the following snippet to your `pom.xml`. If the top section
(`dependencyManagement`) already exists in your pom, add only the contents.

====
[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement> <1>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
            <artifactId>reactor-bom</artifactId>
            <version>Californium-RELEASE</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----
<1> Notice the `dependencyManagement` tag. This is in addition to the regular
`dependencies` section.
====

Next, add your dependencies to the relevant reactor projects, as usual (except without a
`<version>`). The following listing shows how to do so:

====
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.projectreactor.netty</groupId>
        <artifactId>reactor-netty</artifactId> <1>
        <2>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
<1> Dependency on `Reactor Netty`
<2> No version tag here
====

=== Gradle Installation

Gradle has no core support for Maven BOMs, but you can use Spring's
https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin[gradle-dependency-management]
plugin.

First, apply the plugin from the Gradle Plugin Portal.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id "io.spring.dependency-management" version "1.0.7.RELEASE" <1>
}
----
<1> as of this writing, `1.0.7.RELEASE` is the latest version of the plugin.
Check for updates.
====

Then use it to import the BOM. The following listing shows how to do so:

====
[source,groovy]
----
dependencyManagement {
     imports {
          mavenBom "io.projectreactor:reactor-bom:Californium-RELEASE"
     }
}
----
====

Finally, add a dependency to your project, without a version number.
The following listing shows how to do so:

====
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
     compile 'io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty' <1>
}
----
<1> There is no third `:` separated section for the version. It is taken from
the `BOM`.
====

=== Milestones and Snapshots

Milestones and developer previews are distributed through the `Spring Milestones`
repository rather than `Maven Central`. To add it to your build configuration
file, use the following snippet:

====
.Milestones in Maven
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>spring-milestones</id>
		<name>Spring Milestones Repository</name>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----
====

For Gradle, use the following snippet:

====
.Milestones in Gradle
[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
  maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/milestone' }
  mavenCentral()
}
----
====

Similarly, snapshots are also available in a separate dedicated repository
(for both Maven and Gradle):

====
.BUILD-SNAPSHOTs in Maven
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>spring-snapshots</id>
		<name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----

.BUILD-SNAPSHOTs in Gradle
[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
  maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/snapshot' }
  mavenCentral()
}
----
====
